# Rebase and deep review — 2026-09-15

## Follow-up — 2026-09-16

Rebased onto `e9229ea22`. Added the default-off top-level `enableClaudeCodeSubscription` experiment in Settings, search, picker and turn admission. Disabling preserves existing history and prevents new chats inheriting a disabled Claude default. Claude and Codex now use the same accepted-turn billing key: Agent + Pro is billed, while Build/Ask/Plan or Pro off bypass Dyad credit checks and reports.

Verification: 158 initial focused tests passed; the subsequent full run passed 8,454 tests with one skipped and one stale billing-text assertion. That assertion was updated and all three tests in its suite passed. Types and Electron build passed. Rebuilt real-subscription Electron smoke: **3/3 passed**, including Settings opt-in, no Ask-mode usage reports, restart, Undo continuation and cancellation. Accounting used the contract fixture; live engine charging remains unverified.

PR #4485 was rebased onto `2e40b1690` and reopened. Charging now reuses the shared flat-rate external-model service from #4483/current main; the old 25% reservation/outbox design is removed.

Six independent finder passes covered shallow diff, deep correctness, history, cross-file consistency, error/data flow and explicit project rules. Findings were deduplicated and independently challenged; all eight retained findings scored at least 75/100:

| Finding                                              | Confidence | Fix                                                                                                                     |

Independent follow-up inspection confirmed fixes for the first five. Focused regressions exercise real SDK operation draining, large permission payloads, reference read/write boundaries, cleared session state, expanded commands and accepted-model races. Subsequent top-level review fixes also make restore-created forks usable through fresh CLI sessions with copied visible history, explicitly prohibit persistent consent for per-turn operations, distinguish installed-but-unavailable CLI status, probe CLI status lazily, report operation/turn failures, and prevent model-authored action tags from impersonating host cards. The ChatModeSelector global-source concern was refuted: it already uses the chat-resolved `selectedModel`.

Subsequent PR feedback additionally identified raw dotenv access: deny dotenv paths (including resolved aliases), remove recursive raw Grep from the actual CLI inventory, and guard referenced-app internals. Glob plus guarded Read remains available.

## Verification

- Full suite after the review fixes: **738 files passed; 8,304 tests passed, 1 skipped**. A final narrow typed-error-detail follow-up was checked separately.
- First post-fix targeted run: **192 tests passed**.
- New real handler/DB integration tests: **5 passed**, including summary/security-review/retry/model-race/fresh-fork cases.
- Formatting, lint and main/worker type checks passed for the rebased charging update; final checks and CLI smoke results are recorded in the PR handoff.
- Production Claude charging and commercial release terms remain unverified. Historical 2026-09-04 evidence does not establish the revised charging path.

## Real CLI accounting evidence — 2026-09-15

The rebuilt macOS arm64 app ran the official subscription-authenticated CLI **2.1.261**. The main Electron scenario passed edit approvals, diagnostics/type-check MCP operations, preview refresh, actual-model attribution, continuation across application restart, read-only/shell/dotenv restrictions, and both backend-switch cancellation and confirmation.

[Captured usage](claude-code-rebase-usage-evidence.json) contains five distinct reports for actual `claude-sonnet-5` and auxiliary `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` calls: **97,400 total tokens**, including cache reads. Each report's categories sum exactly to its total; applying the shared $0.10/M rate produces **$0.00974** across the fixture receipts. These are local contract-compatible test-engine receipts, **not live debits**.

The real smoke also passed cancellation while an edit awaited consent. It exposed a remaining same-chat Undo recovery issue: files/history were restored but the old CLI session remained interrupted. Undo now clears the reconciled chat's session identity so the next turn starts fresh from retained visible history; other chats remain invalidated. A handler regression verifies that isolation.

The affected real-CLI Undo scenario was rebuilt and rerun successfully, including a new turn after Undo (**1 passed**); the prior run's main scenario and cancellation both passed (**2 passed**). Three additional review findings were fixed afterward: preserve hashed-attachment sensitivity via original manifest names and deny internal writes; resolve the app directory after the coordinated claim rather than before billing preflight; leave sessionless chats usable after restores. Focused tests cover each boundary.

The full real-CLI Electron suite then passed **all 3 scenarios in 1.2 minutes** on `8cf114ead`. Final automated review additionally identified the global-default/legacy-chat mismatch, unbounded restored history, and setup-state/error UX. Backend-aware model fallback now applies in the picker, mode hook and both admission stages; copied history explicitly limits itself to eight 8000-character messages. Bridge setup cannot strand a new session in `running`, missing CLI errors remain actionable, and unsupported CLI series explicitly require a Dyad update. Unrelated persisted sessions remain invalidated after code restore by design, with Start new chat recovery; silently resuming them against a different tree is unsafe.
