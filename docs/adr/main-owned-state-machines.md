## Context and decision

Dyad will support multiple windows that can show and control the same chat or
app. A renderer controller can therefore no longer be both a window-local
object and the authority for a shared lifecycle. Every actor has one
authoritative host. Shared-entity and resource-owning actors run in main;
window-resource actors remain in the renderer that owns the resource. Windows
subscribe to revisioned, renderer-safe read models and dispatch validated
intent to main.

An actor runtime is preferable to incrementally cleaning up the existing
renderer controllers because multi-window is the forcing function, not merely
controller code quality. Incremental cleanup would leave one controller per
window and require synchronization or leader election between equally writable
copies. The actor runtime instead gives each entity one serial event queue,
one commit point, explicit lifecycle and transport contracts, and read-only
fan-out to every window. The detailed motivation and rollout are in the
[plan](../../plans/cleanup-state-machines.md).

Documented main-owned resource registries may keep specialized listener,
timer, waiter, claim, and close-barrier internals. They expose only the
consumer-driven projection and intent boundary needed by renderers; those
narrow boundaries still obey revision, correlation, hydration, invalidation,
and multi-window convergence rules.

## Recorded product decisions

The following decisions are copied verbatim from the plan.

1. **Same-entity concurrency: shared views, both windows may dispatch.**
   The same chat or app may be visible in multiple windows. Main serializes
   events through one actor. Idempotent intent may apply normally;
   state-sensitive or destructive intent uses the current revision and/or
   invocation identity; cancellation identifies the active invocation.
2. **Window close: main-owned work continues.** Closing or reloading the
   initiating window releases its subscriptions and presentation resources
   but does not implicitly cancel streams, runs, checkouts, image jobs, or
   other main-owned work. Explicit Cancel/Stop remains a user action.
   Renderer-owned work tied to destroyed resources settles or stops according
   to its local machine policy.
3. **Last-window close: platform convention.** On macOS, zero windows does
   not itself mean app quit. On Windows/Linux, last-window close may cause
   actual app quit. Main actors respond to the real application-shutdown
   boundary, not merely subscriber count.
4. **Tabs: independent instances over shared entities, with transfer and
   explicit duplication.** A tab has a stable `TabInstanceId` and belongs
   to one `WindowSessionId`. Dragging moves that same tab instance and
   preserves transferable presentation state. Explicit “Open in New Window”
   or duplication creates a new tab instance that may reference the same
   entity; ordinary navigation may focus an existing tab in the current
   window. Independent instances do not automatically share scroll position,
   selected file, iframe history, panels, dialogs, or drafts.
5. **Presentation routing: initiator first, with typed fallbacks.** Persistent
   lifecycle facts render in every subscribed view. Transient effects route
   by type: operation toasts and navigation stay in the initiating window;
   inline shared errors render in every relevant view; actionable user-input
   requests may render in every relevant window with first-response-wins;
   headless important completion uses a native notification. The fallback for
   ordinary effects is initiating window → most-recent focused window showing
   the entity → any window showing the entity → focused app window →
   notification or no transient effect.

Two implementation consequences are mandatory:

- a stale window action is never accepted merely because it came from a
  trusted renderer; every remote machine records whether each event requires
  no revision, an `expectedRevision`, or an invocation ref;
- moving a tab is an acknowledged handoff: capture transferable state, adopt
  it in the destination, then remove the source. Adoption failure leaves the
  source tab intact.

## Architecture rules

### Authority and delivery

- One authoritative host owns each actor. Main actors key by domain entity;
  renderer actors key by the window-local host and entity.
- A transition commit is the actor's linearization point. A committed dispatch
  receipt does not mean its commands completed, a durable receiver accepted a
  handoff, or the overall operation finished. Those outcomes use separate
  domain receipts and observable lifecycle facts.
- Multi-primary replication is forbidden. Windows never own writable shadow
  copies of main lifecycle state, and Jotai never becomes a conflict-resolution
  layer for machine facts.
- Location is explicit at every call site: local actor-to-actor work uses
  `send`; crossing from a renderer to main uses `dispatch` and returns a typed
  receipt. APIs must not hide whether transport, admission, or completion is
  being awaited.
- Commands execute only in the authoritative host. A transition may commit
  before a command starts, and command settlement re-enters the host as a
  correlated event.

### Security boundary

Remote definitions live in a static manifest; a renderer cannot name an
arbitrary machine or command. Outer envelopes and per-event codecs are
validated, and the event codecs are the allowlist of dispatchable renderer
intent. Every definition supplies entity-scoped authorization in addition to
trusting the renderer process. Commands and runtime handles never cross from
the renderer, and renderer projections explicitly exclude main-only data such
as secrets, process handles, internal paths, prompt content, and unnecessary
attachment bytes. Focus and visibility may select a presentation destination
or capability lease but never authorize a domain mutation.

## Actor lifecycle matrix

The `chat_stream` row incorporates the accepted G1 study. `plan_handoff` rides
that design and is included explicitly because G1 made it a main-owned durable
protocol actor.

Image-generation app-quit rationale: providers may not acknowledge
cancellation, so shutdown attempts cleanup but must not wait indefinitely.

Image-generation restart rationale: generation may cost money and may already
have produced an external side effect, so Dyad must not silently replay it
after a crash; completed files that were committed before shutdown remain.

Renderer-local machines die with their renderer resources and must settle or
compensate their callers. No-subscriber behavior is a per-definition lifecycle
policy, not an implicit cancellation rule.

## Main registries audit

This audit records the current renderer surfaces and the C2 disposition for
the two already-main-authoritative registries. Source locations are the
evidence as of this ADR update; the contracts remain the durable source of
channel names.

Retain until the common transport replaces it only where the connector consumers need revisioned admission. |

Disposition: keep the registry and its narrow lifecycle projection. C2 hardens
`start`/`acknowledge` with authoritative revision admission and replaces the
historical string `flowId` with a typed `ConnectionFlowInvocationRef` minted
through the shared `IdSource`. Cancel and acknowledgment require the exact
active ref; timers, provider callbacks, and every echo-capable boundary carry
it. Deep-link returns that cannot echo it use a documented structural
`InvocationRegistry` claim. C2 also adds explicit shutdown disposal.
`resources-loaded` is not a valid cross-window barrier: after durable
credential persistence, main settles the flow and publishes correlated
provider-status invalidation; each window independently invalidates its local
query families without acknowledging main lifecycle completion.

Disposition: do not publish internal lifecycle states. Connect remains
current-agnostic, last-request-wins intent with a renderer-generated message
ID for retry dedupe; main mints a typed `McpOAuthInvocationRef` and settles the
displaced invocation. The ref is echoed through listener, waiter, timer,
callback, exchange, supersession, and settlement boundaries; it is distinct
from the retry-deduplication message ID. After persisted settlement, publish
MCP server/tool scopes through the global epoch-keyed `QueryInvalidationEvent`
channel so reconnect/bootstrap and gap recovery converge every window. Server
deletion, disconnect, OAuth disable, and OAuth-relevant configuration changes
cancel and settle matching flows and fence stale provider persistence before
changing the row. `ActorHost` would not remove the specialized resource maps
or fix these boundary obligations.

## App-run pilot deletion budget

### C1.3 remote-definition security review

The production `app_run` definition satisfies the B3 boundary checklist:

- the main-owned static manifest registers only the literal `app_run`
  definition; renderer input cannot select a module or command runner;
- the generic envelope and strict `AppRunKeySchema` /
  `AppRunIntentEventSchema` validate independently, and producer/settlement
  variants are absent from the renderer event codec;
- subscribe and dispatch authorize the app entity against main-owned database
  state, while stop additionally proves the exact active invocation and
  state-sensitive start/restart intents require the actor revision;
- renderer payloads contain intents only; `RunCommand`, process handles,
  runtime outputs, paths, and sandbox data are constructed and retained in
  main;
- `AppRunRemoteSnapshotSchema` projects only lifecycle phase, operation,
  start time, URL/mode, operation error, exit details, capabilities, revision,
  and invocation diagnostics. Console bytes stay on the keyed, bounded
  high-volume channel.

C1's trailing deletion implements the following checklist:

- [x] Delete `src/app_run/controller.ts` and
      `src/app_run/controller.test.ts`; the main actor and host conformance tests
      replace `AppRunController`.
- [x] Delete `src/app_run/manager.ts` and `src/app_run/manager.test.ts`, including
      its renderer `KeyedControllerHost`, `InvocationRegistry`, `activeRefs`,
      admitted-exit fallback stores, reload-token stores, and lifecycle listener
      registry.
- [x] Delete `src/app_run/AppRunProvider.tsx`. Replace its manager context and
      renderer entity disposer with the per-window remote actor client/ref.
- [x] Delete the renderer-to-main lifecycle executor in
      `src/app_run/commands.ts`. Main executes start/restart/stop and owns process
      settlement; independently justified renderer console, warning, error, and
      iframe presentation effects move behind typed post-commit consumers.
- [x] Replace `src/hooks/useAppRun.ts` manager subscriptions with selectors over
      the remote lifecycle read model. Remove the manager-backed app-exit fallback
      and reload-token projection APIs.
- [x] Remove lifecycle routing in `src/hooks/useRunApp.ts`: its
      `beginExternal`/`settleExternal` bridge, renderer ownership of run/restart/
      rebuild/stop dispatch, and producer-event admission. The hook may remain as
      a UI facade over remote dispatch receipts and keyed console subscriptions.
- [x] Replace the `AppRunStateSubscriptionFacade` implementation in
      `src/app_wiring/cross_machine_facades.ts` and the manager wiring in
      `src/app/layout.tsx` with the renderer remote read model. Keep
      `preview_iframe` renderer-owned.
- [x] Remove `PreviewIframeProvider`'s dependency on `AppRunManager` in
      `src/preview_iframe/PreviewIframeProvider.tsx`; feed it typed post-commit
      app-run lifecycle events carrying actor/invocation identity.
- [x] Remove timestamp/map-edge inference embodied by the admitted-exit fallback
      and `selectAppExit` timestamp comparison in `src/app_run/manager.ts`.
      `src/app_run/selectors.ts` may remain only for pure selection over the safe
      remote schema; no timestamp may stand in for invocation identity.
- [x] Rewrite affected renderer-centric tests in `src/hooks/useRunApp.test.tsx`
      and `src/preview_iframe/usePreviewIframe.test.tsx` as remote-bootstrap,
      cross-window dispatch, post-commit composition, and capability-routing
      tests before deleting their manager fixtures.

The pure transition/state definitions may move to main and remain if they
still describe the authoritative actor. Console buffers, package-manager
warnings, preview errors, and iframe state are retained only where they have
an independent owner and are not lifecycle authorities.

## Remote intent classification

The tables account for every event in the current unions. “Host-only” is not
an additional remote intent class: it means the event is deliberately absent
from the remote codec allowlist and can enter only through an authorized main
producer or command settlement. Classifications describe the target remote
contract, so they also identify required schema changes to today's
renderer-owned unions.

For state-sensitive mutations the caller supplies `expectedRevision`; queue
mutations use `expectedQueueRevision`. Cancellation supplies the active
invocation ref. Idempotent/current-agnostic intent requires no revision but
still carries its domain idempotency/correlation key where noted. Presentation
intent never changes domain state and is routed after commit.

| `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_STARTED`, `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_CANCELLED`                                                                                                         | Claim-sensitive; allow a stale revision only when the exact active claim ID matches.                                 |
| `BANNER_DISMISSED`, `RECONCILE_REQUESTED`                                                                                                                              | Idempotent/current-agnostic; no revision. Reconciliation probes repository truth before applying a lifecycle change. |
| `OP_SUCCEEDED`, `OP_FAILED`, `CONFLICTS`, `GIT_STATE`, `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_CLAIM_EXPIRED`                                                                             | Host-only command/probe/timer settlement correlated to the active operation or claim internally.                     |

The C2 implementation verified the lifecycle row against the current Git
operations: mutations already run to process settlement in main, repository
truth is recoverable from Git metadata, and app deletion is serialized with
the per-app mutation lock. The hosted actor therefore retains active work with
no subscribers, survives reload and last-window close, reconciles Git state
when recreated, and is disposed only after deletion has acquired the same
per-app lock. Shutdown stops new admission and gives already-started Git
commands a bounded settlement window; an interrupted process is recovered from
repository truth on the next start rather than replayed.

Serializability audit:

- `GithubOpsState`, operations, banners, failures, conflict names, and all
  renderer intents are plain encoded values. Active command settlement uses a
  typed `GithubOpsInvocationRef`; callbacks, promises, process handles,
  `Error` instances, and service objects are excluded from state and events.
- `OP_SUCCEEDED`, `OP_FAILED`, `CONFLICTS`, and `GIT_STATE` are host-only.
  Renderer codecs admit only the intent rows above.
- The former per-app conflict-resolution callback registry is replaced by a
  receipt plus an opaque, correlated claim. After main applies
  `RESOLVE_WITH_AI_STARTED`, only the claimant starts its local
  chat/navigation flow. Matching follow-ups are safe across a stale snapshot;
  unrelated reconciliation cannot release the claim, peers see a claimed
  projection, and an actor-owned timeout releases an abandoned claim.

The remote read model contains the existing `GithubOpsState` projection,
snapshot revision, and the active typed invocation reference needed for
cancellation. Conflict entries are repository-relative names required by the
existing resolution UI. It excludes access tokens, authenticated remote URLs,
absolute app/repository paths, Git command handles, and settings/database
records. Main also replaces Git failure text containing remotes, credentials,
or absolute paths before it enters the snapshot.

The migration deletion budget is the renderer `GithubOpsController`,
`GithubOpsManager`, `GithubOpsCommandRunner`, its hand-written FIFO and probe
generation maps, the conflict-runner registry, and the mutation/probe IPC
channels used only by that adapter. Branch and app cache refreshes move to the
global query-invalidation epoch channel; the existing branch inventory query
and `useGithubOps`/`projectGithubOps` consumer surface remain.

The stacked deletion PR completes that budget: all three renderer adapter
modules and their tests are removed, along with the Git mutation and
repository-state probe contracts and registrations that only the command
runner invoked. Main keeps the underlying handler functions as internal
service operations, while branch inventory and other independently used
read-only contracts remain registered.

| `CLOSE`, `APP_CHANGED`, `SELECT_VERSION`, `SWITCH_BRANCH`, `RESTORE`, `RESTORE_TO_MESSAGE`, `RETRY_RETURN`                                                                                                            | State-sensitive; require `expectedRevision` because each can start, queue, retry, or compensate a repository mutation. |
| `ORIGIN_RESOLVED`, `ORIGIN_RESOLUTION_FAILED`, `CHECKOUT_SUCCEEDED`, `CHECKOUT_FAILED`, `RESTORE_SUCCEEDED`, `RESTORE_FAILED`, `RETURN_SUCCEEDED`, `RETURN_FAILED`, `SWITCH_BRANCH_SUCCEEDED`, `SWITCH_BRANCH_FAILED` | Host-only command settlement, correlated to the active checkout/recovery invocation internally.                        |

`OPEN` is listed as presentation-only because opening a pane is not domain
work. Any origin-resolution needed before a later checkout starts from that
state-sensitive checkout intent, not from pane visibility.

### `image_generation`

| Event                                                                           | Classification and admission                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Job creation (currently manager construction rather than an event-union member) | Idempotent/current-agnostic with immutable `jobId`; no revision. Same-key/different-payload replay is rejected. |
| `CANCEL_REQUESTED`                                                              | Cancellation; the remote form must add and require the active image-job invocation ref.                         |
| `JOB_SUCCEEDED`, `JOB_FAILED`, `CANCEL_CONFIRMED`                               | Host-only provider/cancellation settlement correlated to the job invocation internally.                         |

The C2 implementation uses one main-owned collection actor because the
existing manager projection consumed by renderers is exactly the complete job
list. Commands remain concurrent per job, while ActorHost serializes changes
to that shared read model. An immutable renderer-minted `jobId` is the retry
idempotency identity; the separately minted `ImageGenerationInvocationRef`
correlates provider settlement and is required for cancellation.

Serializability audit:

- job payloads contain prompt text, theme, target app identity, source, and
  timestamps as plain structured-clone values; no attachment bytes are part of
  image-generation state;
- generated image bytes, fetch responses, `AbortController`s, promises,
  filesystem locks, API credentials, and provider `Error` objects remain in
  the main service;
- the remote job-list projection includes relative media/app references and
  the active invocation ref needed for cancellation, but excludes the
  generated file's absolute path; both retained jobs and initiator-targeted
  success presentation open media through a main-owned action keyed by app ID
  and file name;
- renderer codecs admit only `SUBMIT` and correlated
  `CANCEL_REQUESTED`. Provider settlement, pruning, and app-deletion events are
  host-only.

The lifecycle policy retains the singleton collection without subscribers,
reattaches windows to the same list, and gives each terminal job an independent
30-minute prune deadline. App quit
stops actor admission, aborts every active provider request, and waits only for
a bounded settlement window. State is ephemeral across app restart and jobs
are never replayed; committed media remains. App deletion fences new admission,
prunes matching jobs before aborting provider work, and waits only for bounded
settlement.

The atomic deletion budget is complete: the renderer
`ImageGenerationController`, `ImageGenerationManager`, IPC command runner,
per-job keyed dispatcher host, generate/cancel invoke contracts and handlers,
and provider-owned projection/toast orchestration are removed. The provider
now consumes typed presentation events, while
`dismissedImageGenerationJobIdsAtom` remains intentionally window-local UI
state composed with the remote read model.

### `chat_stream` (accepted G1 target; current union provisional)

G1 is accepted, but the current renderer event union predates its target
protocol. The first table classifies every current `StreamEvent`
provisionally; C3 replaces it with the accepted intents in the second table.

The G1 target exposes plan acceptance and the final implementation submission
as durable handoffs. Navigation, preview-mode changes, accepted badges, and
failure toasts are presentation-only post-commit events and are not fed back
as domain authority.
