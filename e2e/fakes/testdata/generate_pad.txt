## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design for a wiz software

There once was a fellow from Leeds, Who swallowed a packet of seeds. Through his beard and his hair Grew cucumbers fair, And tomatoes adorned both his knees!

His garden-like state caused a stir, As people would point and refer: "That man is a patch! He's grown quite a batch! His produce is quite amateur!"

He visited doctors galore, Who'd never seen anything more. They studied his case With puzzled embrace, While radishes sprouted some more!

The man made the best of his state, And opened his yard as estate. He charged folks to see His botany spree, And now lives in garden-rich fate!

Notes for Revision:

Consider adding more verses about specific vegetables

Could expand on the doctors' reactions

Might add a moral to the story

Possible alternate endings:

He becomes a famous botanical attraction

He starts a new farming technique

He wins a gardening competition

Technical Elements:

Maintains AABBA rhyme scheme

Uses anapestic meter

Includes internal rhymes
