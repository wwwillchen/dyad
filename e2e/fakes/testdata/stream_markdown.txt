I'll add a comprehensive comment to the code editor file explaining its purpose and functionality.

```typescript path="src/dyad_app/web_components/code_editor.ts"
/**
 * CodeEditor Web Component
 * 
 * A custom web component that wraps the Monaco Editor for code editing functionality.
 * Built using LitElement
 */

// (keep rest of the code the same)
```

- Should we add debug logging to track editor initialization?
- The editor isn't updating when the theme changes - suggestions?
- How can we handle very large files without performance issues?
