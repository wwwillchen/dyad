## Nightly Runner Cleanup

The `nightly-runner-cleanup.yml` workflow runs at 12:00 UTC (4:00 AM PST / 5:00 AM PDT) on self-hosted macOS runners `ci1` through `ci4` to reclaim disk space and reboot each machine.

Each runner account must be allowed to schedule the workflow's exact reboot command without a password. Configure this with `visudo` in a file under `/etc/sudoers.d/`:

```sudoers
# ci1, ci2, and ci3
ci ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown -r +1

# ci4
ci4 ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown -r +1
```

The Actions runner service must also start without an interactive login after reboot. The workflow waits three minutes before dispatching verification jobs and fails verification if a machine's uptime is greater than 15 minutes.

**Validation (manual run):**

1. Go to Actions → Nightly Runner Cleanup → Run workflow.
2. Confirm the run completes successfully and logs show cleanup running on each runner.
3. Check logs for "Disk before" and "Disk after" to verify space reclaimed from `/System/Volumes/Data`.
4. Confirm each runner re-registers and verification reports an uptime under 15 minutes.

**Expected behavior:** Deletes only allowlisted paths (npm cache, Playwright browsers, inactive runner repository workspaces older than 2 days, Library/Caches subdirs). It preserves the active workspace and runner-owned `_work` directories such as `_temp` and `_PipelineMapping`, and never removes runner binaries, config, or user data outside caches.
