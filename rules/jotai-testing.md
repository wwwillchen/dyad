# Jotai Testing

Learnings for writing unit tests against components/hooks that read or write Jotai atoms.

## Sharing a store across `renderHook` calls in a single test

When a test needs to render a hook, unmount it, and then render the hook again (e.g., to verify state persists across an unmount/remount — the exact scenario for atoms that replace local `useState`), all `renderHook` calls must share the **same Jotai store**. Otherwise each `renderHook`'s `Provider` wrapper creates its own isolated store and writes made by the first hook are invisible to the second.

**Wrong** — each call to `makeWrapper()` returns a component that creates a fresh `<Provider>` (no store prop), so every `renderHook` gets a new default store:

```tsx
function makeWrapper() {
  return function Wrapper({ children }) {
    return <Provider>{children}</Provider>;
  };
}
```

**Right** — create one store per test and bind every `renderHook` in that test to it:

```tsx
import { createStore, Provider } from "jotai";

function makeWrapper() {
  const store = createStore();
  return function Wrapper({ children }) {
    return <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
  };
}

// In the test:
const wrapper = makeWrapper();
const first = renderHook(() => useMyAtomHook(id), { wrapper });
// ... mutate state ...
first.unmount();
const second = renderHook(() => useMyAtomHook(id), { wrapper });
// second now sees state written by first
```

The symptom when you get this wrong is assertions like `expected false to be true` on the remounted hook's state, even though the setter clearly ran against the first hook.

See `src/atoms/githubSyncAtoms.test.tsx` for a complete example covering unmount/remount, cross-unmount completion, and per-key isolation.

## No jest-dom matchers

The vitest setup does not register `@testing-library/jest-dom`, so matchers like `toBeInTheDocument()` or `toBeDisabled()` fail with `Invalid Chai property: toBeInTheDocument`. Use plain assertions instead: `expect(screen.queryByTestId(...)).toBeNull()` / `.not.toBeNull()` for presence, and `expect((button as HTMLButtonElement).disabled).toBe(false)` for disabled state.

## Hooks That Indirectly Use React Query

If a `renderHook` test starts failing with `No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one`, check whether the hook now calls another hook such as `useSettings()` or `useAppVersion()` that uses TanStack Query internally. Either wrap the test in a `QueryClientProvider` or mock the indirect hook when the test is only exercising Jotai/event behavior.

## Partial `jotai` Mocks

When a component test mocks `jotai`, preserve the real module exports with `importOriginal` and override only the needed hooks. A full mock that only returns `useAtomValue` can fail during test collection with `[vitest] No "atom" export is defined on the "jotai" mock` once an indirectly imported atom module calls `atom(...)`.

## Seeding a running app URL

Don't try to make a component see a running dev server by writing preview-runtime atoms on a test store — `@/atoms/previewRuntimeAtoms` was deleted (symptom: `Failed to resolve import "@/atoms/previewRuntimeAtoms"`). Mock the hook instead, as `PreviewPanel.test.tsx` and `TestsPanel.test.tsx` do:

```ts
vi.mock("@/hooks/useAppRun", () => ({
  useCurrentAppUrl: () => ({
    appUrl: "http://localhost:32100",
    appId: 1,
    originalUrl: "http://localhost:32100",
    mode: "host" as const,
  }),
}));
```
