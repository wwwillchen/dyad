# Jotai Testing

Learnings for writing unit tests against components/hooks that read or write Jotai atoms.

## Sharing a store across `renderHook` calls in a single test

When a test needs to render a hook, unmount it, and then render the hook again (e.g., to verify state persists across an unmount/remount — the exact scenario for atoms that replace local `useState`), all `renderHook` calls must share the **same Jotai store**. Otherwise each `renderHook`'s `Provider` wrapper creates its own isolated store and writes made by the first hook are invisible to the second.

**Wrong** — each call to `makeWrapper()` returns a component that creates a fresh `<Provider>` (no store prop), so every `renderHook` gets a new default store:

```tsx
function makeWrapper() {
  return function Wrapper({ children }) {
    return <Provider>{children}</Provider>;
  };
}
```

**Right** — create one store per test and bind every `renderHook` in that test to it:

```tsx
import { createStore, Provider } from "jotai";

function makeWrapper() {
  const store = createStore();
  return function Wrapper({ children }) {
    return <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
  };
}

// In the test:
const wrapper = makeWrapper();
const first = renderHook(() => useMyAtomHook(id), { wrapper });
// ... mutate state ...
first.unmount();
const second = renderHook(() => useMyAtomHook(id), { wrapper });
// second now sees state written by first
```

The symptom when you get this wrong is assertions like `expected false to be true` on the remounted hook's state, even though the setter clearly ran against the first hook.

See `src/atoms/githubSyncAtoms.test.tsx` for a complete example covering unmount/remount, cross-unmount completion, and per-key isolation.

## StrictMode: use the `reactStrictMode` option, not a nested `<StrictMode>`

`<StrictMode>` only replays mount effects when it is the **root** of the rendered tree. A wrapper component of your own that renders `<StrictMode>` around `children` — which is what you end up writing as soon as you also need a Jotai `Provider` — does not replay: the mount effect runs once and a StrictMode-only bug passes the test. Measured with `@testing-library/react` v16:

| how StrictMode is introduced                                                                            | mount effect runs |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `renderHook(…, { wrapper: StrictMode })`                                                                | 2                 |
| `renderHook(…, { reactStrictMode: true })`                                                              | 2                 |
| `renderHook(…, { wrapper: MyWrapper })` where `MyWrapper` renders `<StrictMode>{children}</StrictMode>` | **1**             |
| `render(<StrictMode><Ui /></StrictMode>)`                                                               | 2                 |
| `render(<Ui />, { wrapper: MyWrapper })`                                                                | **1**             |

This is not a `renderHook` quirk — `render()` behaves the same way. Pass the render option, which composes with whatever wrapper you already need: `renderHook(() => useThing(), { wrapper, reactStrictMode: true })`.

Worth testing because the app renders under `<StrictMode>` (`src/renderer.tsx`), where the dev mount/unmount/remount replay runs cleanup on a hook that is still mounted. A "am I still mounted" ref must therefore be re-armed in the effect body, not just at ref creation:

```tsx
const mountedRef = useRef(true);
useEffect(() => {
  mountedRef.current = true; // without this, permanently false after the replay
  return () => {
    mountedRef.current = false;
  };
}, []);
```

## No jest-dom matchers

The vitest setup does not register `@testing-library/jest-dom`, so matchers like `toBeInTheDocument()` or `toBeDisabled()` fail with `Invalid Chai property: toBeInTheDocument`. Use plain assertions instead: `expect(screen.queryByTestId(...)).toBeNull()` / `.not.toBeNull()` for presence, and `expect((button as HTMLButtonElement).disabled).toBe(false)` for disabled state.

## `act()` hides passive-effect timing windows

React Testing Library wraps `render`/`rerender`/`fireEvent` in `act()`, which
flushes passive effects synchronously before yielding to the microtask queue. A
promise continuation therefore always runs _after_ effects in tests, so bugs that
live in the window between commit and passive-effect flush cannot be reproduced
with RTL. Don't burn time writing a failing test for one — fix it (usually by
moving the bookkeeping to `useLayoutEffect`) and say in the PR why coverage stops
at the app-switch behavior.

## Hooks That Indirectly Use React Query

If a `renderHook` test starts failing with `No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one`, check whether the hook now calls another hook such as `useSettings()` or `useAppVersion()` that uses TanStack Query internally. Either wrap the test in a `QueryClientProvider` or mock the indirect hook when the test is only exercising Jotai/event behavior.

`useStreamChat()` has the same shape but a different error — `useChatStreamManager requires ChatStreamProvider`. Watch for it when **hoisting a component out of a tab/route switch**: `PreviewPanel.test.tsx` renders the panel bare and mocks each child, so anything newly rendered at panel level runs its hooks for real. Split the component in two — an outer one that reads only atoms and returns `null` when the feature is inactive, and an inner one holding the chat/query hooks — so the provider is only needed when the feature is actually on screen. Mock the new child in the parent's suite the way its siblings already are.

## Preview `postMessage` Tests Need an App URL

Hooks that consume preview-iframe messages (e.g. `useTestRecorder`) validate `event.origin` against the running app's origin and **fail closed** when it isn't known. A `renderHook` test that only sets `previewIframeRefAtom` will therefore see every message silently dropped — with no error, because dropping a foreign message is the correct behavior.

The app URL is **not** a Jotai atom: `appUrlByAppIdAtom` was retired (see `rules/jotai-state.md`, and the retired-name guard in `src/state_machines/boundaries.test.ts`), and the URL now comes from `useCurrentAppUrl` in `@/hooks/useAppRun`. Mock that hook, backing it with an atom of your own so a test can also take the URL away mid-session — which is what the dev-server restart during isolation setup does:

```tsx
const testAppUrlAtom = atom<AppUrlState>({
  appUrl: null,
  appId: null,
  originalUrl: null,
  mode: null,
});
vi.mock("@/hooks/useAppRun", () => ({
  useCurrentAppUrl: () => useAtomValue(testAppUrlAtom),
}));

store.set(testAppUrlAtom, {
  appUrl: "https://preview.test/",
  appId: 1,
  originalUrl: "https://preview.test/",
  mode: "host",
});
```

Then dispatch the `MessageEvent` with a matching origin:

```tsx
const event = new MessageEvent("message", {
  data,
  origin: "https://preview.test",
});
Object.defineProperty(event, "source", { value: iframe.contentWindow }); // read-only on the prototype
```

Have the iframe stand-in record the **target origin** each outgoing `postMessage` was given, not just the payload — a hook that sends credentials into the preview pins them to the app's origin, and a fake with a one-argument `postMessage` cannot tell that apart from a wide-open `"*"`. See `src/hooks/useTestRecorder.test.tsx` for the whole harness.

## Partial `jotai` Mocks

When a component test mocks `jotai`, preserve the real module exports with `importOriginal` and override only the needed hooks. A full mock that only returns `useAtomValue` can fail during test collection with `[vitest] No "atom" export is defined on the "jotai" mock` once an indirectly imported atom module calls `atom(...)`.

## Seeding a running app URL

Don't try to make a component see a running dev server by writing preview-runtime atoms on a test store — `@/atoms/previewRuntimeAtoms` was deleted (symptom: `Failed to resolve import "@/atoms/previewRuntimeAtoms"`). Mock the hook instead, as `PreviewPanel.test.tsx` and `TestsPanel.test.tsx` do:

```ts
vi.mock("@/hooks/useAppRun", () => ({
  useCurrentAppUrl: () => ({
    appUrl: "http://localhost:32100",
    appId: 1,
    originalUrl: "http://localhost:32100",
    mode: "host" as const,
  }),
}));
```
