# Electron Workers and Main-Process Memory

Read this when spawning `worker_threads` or `utilityProcess` children, moving heavy computation off the main process, or diagnosing main-process memory usage and OOM crashes.

## The shared 4 GB V8 heap cage

- Electron builds V8 with pointer compression (the "memory cage", enabled since Electron 21), which caps the V8 heap at ~4 GB — and the cap is effectively **process-wide**: all isolates in a process, meaning the main isolate plus every `worker_threads` worker, share one cage. Verified empirically on Electron 40: `v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit` reports 4 GB _per isolate_, yet two worker_threads each OOM-abort at ~2 GB (~4 GB combined).
- A worker_thread that exhausts the heap does **not** fail gracefully: V8 fatal-aborts the **entire process** (`FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit` → SIGABRT / `EXC_BREAKPOINT` in Electron Framework). Main-process native crashes on very large user apps have this signature.
- `--max-old-space-size` cannot raise the cap, whether passed via js-flags, `NODE_OPTIONS`, or `execArgv`.
- Consequence: memory-heavy workloads (full `ts.createIncrementalProgram` builds, whole-project indexes) belong in a `utilityProcess`, which gets its **own** cage and whose OOM surfaces as a child `exit` event instead of an app crash. Keep `worker_threads` for small, bounded work — and set `resourceLimits` (`maxOldGenerationSizeMb`): exceeding it terminates only that worker with `ERR_WORKER_OUT_OF_MEMORY` rather than aborting the process.

## utilityProcess conversion checklist

- `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` fork is **not** available to app code: the `RunAsNode` fuse is disabled in `forge.config.ts`. Use `utilityProcess.fork` (available only after app ready). The fuse is applied at package time, so the dev `node_modules/.bin/electron` binary still honors the env var — `rules/native-modules.md` uses that to run Vitest against Electron's ABI. That is a local test-runner recipe, not a pattern for anything the app spawns.
- Worker entrypoints must be listed in the forge VitePlugin build config. It emits files such as `code_explorer_worker.js` next to `main.js`, and `path.join(__dirname, "<worker>.js")` resolves both in dev and inside `app.asar`.
- Worker side: use `process.parentPort`; messages arrive as a `MessageEvent` — read `event.data`, not the raw argument. The `workers/` tsconfig has no Electron typings; declare a minimal local `UtilityProcessParentPort` interface instead of importing `electron`.
- Send only after `spawn`: calling `child.postMessage()` before the `spawn` event relies on undocumented buffering. Construct the input and post it inside `child.on("spawn", ...)`.
- Settle-once discipline: exactly one of message/error/exit/timeout may settle a request. Reject on **any** pre-reply exit, including exit code 0 (a clean early exit otherwise hangs the caller forever). Always `child.kill()` on every settle path, and add a hard timeout.
- When different utility workloads must never coexist, serializing requests is not enough if one workload keeps an idle process/cache alive. Track the resident process separately, mark it stopping as soon as eviction begins, and await its actual `exit` before forking the next workload; tests must model the `kill()` → `exit` gap.
- Put a deadline on resident shutdown so a missing `exit` cannot hold the scheduler forever, but do **not** clear the resident or launch another process on timeout. Reject that queued operation, reset the cached stop attempt, and mark the resident non-reusable — its owner has already detached its handle — so every later operation (same-kind included) retries the stop instead of reusing it; a real exit then clears the registration without weakening mutual exclusion.
- The UtilityProcess `error` event is experimental in Electron 40; handle it defensively and treat `type === "FatalError"` as probable OOM — map it to a user-facing message ("ran out of memory ... very large apps") instead of surfacing a raw V8 error.
- Electron 40's `utilityProcess.fork` delivers `execArgv` to `process.execArgv` but does **not apply V8 flags from it**: `--expose-gc` and `--max-old-space-size` are no-ops, and `NODE_OPTIONS` via `env` is ignored too. To get `gc()` inside the child, acquire it at runtime — `v8.setFlagsFromString("--expose-gc")` then `vm.runInNewContext("gc")` — and degrade gracefully (measure without forced GC) if that ever stops working.
- Give children a `serviceName` so they are identifiable in `app.getAppMetrics()` and Activity Monitor.
- Unit-test the child lifecycle with a file-scoped `vi.mock("electron")` whose `utilityProcess.fork` returns an EventEmitter-backed fake child (emit spawn/message/error/exit; spy on postMessage/kill). The shared inert mock in `src/testing/electron_mock.ts` cannot emit events, and the AGENTS.md test mandate applies: cover the timeout, pre-reply-exit, fatal-error, and settle-once paths, not just the happy path.
- When a user flow depends on a packaged utility-process bundle, add a focused Electron E2E that reaches the real worker entrypoint. Unit lifecycle tests and hybrid fallbacks verify their own contracts but cannot catch missing worker output, external runtime dependencies, or packaged message wiring.

## External worker runtime dependencies

- When a worker keeps a scoped runtime package external to its Vite bundle, Forge's `ignore` filter must allow the scope directory (for example `/node_modules/@typescript`) as well as the exact package directories. Electron Packager prunes the parent before visiting allowed descendants otherwise. Verify the built ASAR contains both the worker and every external package entrypoint.
- npm alias dependencies can expose a transitive `bin` at the root `.bin` directory and replace another package's same-named shim. Build/type-check scripts that require a particular package version should invoke that package's JavaScript entrypoint directly instead of relying on the shared shim.

## Measuring memory honestly

- Logged main-process RSS **includes** all worker_threads — they are threads, not processes. Renderer/GPU/utility processes are separate; enumerate them with `app.getAppMetrics()`.
- On macOS, `os.totalmem() - os.freemem()` is misleading: `os.freemem()` counts only truly-free pages, so reclaimable file cache reads as "used" (a healthy 16 GB Mac can show ~85% "used" by this formula while `memory_pressure` reports the system 86% free). For real pressure signals use `vm_stat` (pageouts, compressed pages), `sysctl vm.swapusage`, and `memory_pressure`.
- Two V8 string facts that change memory math: ASCII text is stored at 1 byte/char (not 2), and string concatenation builds lazy cons strings — a `` `${prefix} ${hugeString}` `` template is nearly free until something flattens it (e.g. `JSON.stringify`). Corollary: never re-materialize codebase-scale strings just to measure them — sum `content.length` values instead of `join(...)` followed by `.length`.

## Development launcher cleanup

- Treat Ctrl+C cleanup for `npm start` as development tooling; do not add signal-only shutdown behavior to packaged runtime paths. A POSIX supervisor should launch Electron Forge as a process-group leader and signal the negative group PID so Forge, Electron, renderer helpers, and preview servers are terminated together.
- Keep SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP handlers installed until forced cleanup finishes. npm and the controlling PTY can deliver repeated signals; a one-shot handler lets a later signal terminate the supervisor before its fallback timer kills children that ignored SIGTERM.
- Electron's macOS Crashpad handler leaves the Forge process group, and a killed Electron process can remain registered with LaunchServices. Clean up the checkout-specific Crashpad PID separately and notify `lsappinfo` of the Electron PID's exit so no helper or Dock entry remains.
