# Database & Drizzle ORM

This app uses SQLite and drizzle ORM.

When logic depends on conversation insertion adjacency (for example, finding
the assistant response immediately after a user message), order messages by
`messages.id`, not `createdAt`. Compaction summaries may be inserted later with
an older logical timestamp, so timestamp ordering can move them ahead of the
response they followed in storage.

Generate SQL migrations by running this:

```sh
npm run db:generate
```

IMPORTANT: Do NOT generate SQL migration files by hand! This is wrong.

For SQL that drizzle cannot model (FTS5 virtual tables, triggers), generate a correctly numbered scaffold with `npm run db:generate -- --custom --name <slug>` and put the hand-written SQL inside it (statements separated by `--> statement-breakpoint`). Model any ordinary companion tables in `schema.ts` and generate their migration normally first. `createInMemoryTestDb()` applies the real `./drizzle` migrations, so virtual tables and triggers are exercised in unit tests automatically.

## Neon migration preview

When diffing Neon branches with `ts-pg-schema-diff`, use unpooled connection
URIs. Neon pooled `-pooler` hosts reject PostgreSQL startup `options` like
`statement_timeout` with `unsupported startup parameter in options`.

## Drizzle migration conflicts during rebase

When rebasing a branch that has drizzle migrations conflicting with upstream (e.g., both have `0028_*.sql`), prefer regenerating over manually editing snapshot/journal files:

1. During the conflict, accept upstream's `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` and `drizzle/meta/00XX_snapshot.json` with `git checkout --ours <file>` (in a rebase, `--ours` = the branch being rebased onto, i.e. upstream).
2. Force-remove the PR's conflicting `drizzle/00XX_*.sql` with `git rm -f` (it's staged as a new file and must be unstaged via `-f`).
3. Stage the resolved metadata and run `git rebase --continue`. Verify `src/db/schema.ts` still contains the PR's schema additions (e.g., `nitroEnabled` column) — the rebase usually merges these correctly.
4. After the rebase completes, run `npm run db:generate` — drizzle-kit will compare the schema to the latest snapshot and emit a fresh `00YY_*.sql` and `00YY_snapshot.json` with the correct next index and `prevId`.
5. Commit the regenerated migration. Either as a separate commit (e.g., `chore(db): renumber migration to 00YY after rebase`), or — to keep each commit's schema and migration self-consistent — fold it back into the commit that introduced the schema change: `git add drizzle/ && git commit --fixup=<schema-commit-sha>` then `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash upstream/main`. The autosquash is conflict-free since the regenerated files are new.

This avoids manual snapshot/journal editing and `prevId` mistakes. Verify afterward with `npm run db:generate` — it should report `No schema changes, nothing to migrate` if the snapshot is cumulative and consistent.

**When the branch has a _chain_ of migration commits** (multiple migrations added and/or a "consolidate migrations" commit), the same `00XX_snapshot.json`/`_journal.json` conflicts recur on nearly every commit during rebase — don't try to hand-merge each one. Instead resolve each intermediate conflict just enough to proceed (e.g. `git checkout --theirs` the meta files, `git rm -f` orphaned renamed `.sql`), let the whole rebase finish, then do one clean reset: `rm` every extra `drizzle/00XX_*.sql` your branch added beyond upstream's set, `rm -rf drizzle/meta && git checkout upstream/main -- drizzle/meta`, and run a single `npm run db:generate`. drizzle-kit emits one cumulative migration for all your schema additions. Confirm with `git diff upstream/main --stat -- drizzle/` (should show only the new migration) and a second `db:generate` reporting `No schema changes`.

### Local dev DB breaks after renumbering (`Failed to run the query 'ALTER TABLE ... ADD ...'`)

Renumbering a migration during rebase (e.g. the PR's `0032_*` → regenerated `0033_*`) breaks any **local dev DB that already applied the old-numbered migration**. The better-sqlite3 migrator only compares the single newest `created_at` in `__drizzle_migrations` against each journal entry's `when`, so:

- The renumbered migration (`0033`, later `when`) re-runs and fails with ``Failed to run the query 'ALTER TABLE `apps` ADD `...`'`` — the column already exists from the old `0032`.
- Any genuinely-new upstream migration whose `when` is **older** than your last-applied timestamp (e.g. `0032_nostalgic_orphan`) is silently **skipped**, so its columns never get added.

CI and fresh installs are unaffected (they apply `0000→00YY` in order). Fix the dev DB at `./userData/sqlite.db` (dev `getUserDataPath()` = `./userData`) **without wiping data**: build a reference DB by replaying every journalled `.sql` into an in-memory sqlite, diff `PRAGMA table_info` per table against the dev DB to find the truly-missing columns, manually apply the skipped migration's `ALTER`s, then `INSERT INTO __drizzle_migrations (hash, created_at)` a row whose `created_at` = the renumbered migration's journal `when` (hash = `sha256` of the `.sql` file bytes) so the migrator no-ops. Back up `sqlite.db` first. Use Python's stdlib `sqlite3` for this — the bundled `better-sqlite3` is built for Electron's ABI and throws `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` under system Node. "Extra" dev-DB columns from other branches you've run are inert; leave them. Deleting `./userData/sqlite.db` also works but loses local apps/chats.
