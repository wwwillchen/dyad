# App operation coordination

Use `appOperationCoordinator` for main-process operations that need exclusion
against other work on the same app. Declare only the resources the operation
actually touches; never use a raw numeric `appId` with `withLock`.

## Resource domains

| Resource          | Protects                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app-path`        | The app row's path and directory identity. Path consumers take read access; rename, relocation, template path swaps, and deletion take write access. |
| `chat-content`    | Destructive chat/message mutations.                                                                                                                  |
| `chat-membership` | Chat creation and app-deletion child snapshots.                                                                                                      |
| `media`           | Files in the app media collection.                                                                                                                   |
| `metadata`        | Read-modify-write app metadata fields.                                                                                                               |
| `provider`        | Neon/Supabase associations and provider lifecycle state.                                                                                             |
| `repository`      | Git HEAD, refs, index, and working-tree mutations. Read access is sufficient for a stable snapshot such as a new chat's initial commit.              |
| `runtime`         | Process, proxy, port, and sandbox lifecycle.                                                                                                         |
| `runtime-config`  | Environment/configuration consumed when starting the runtime. Runtime lifecycle reads it; test/provider environment swaps write it.                  |
| `test-files`      | Test execution inputs and test artifact mutations.                                                                                                   |

For one app, operations acquire all resources atomically, so callers must
declare the full set up front rather than nesting another operation for that
app. Cross-app operations may compose per-app acquisitions only in ascending
numeric app-ID order, after deduplicating the IDs, so every caller uses the
same global order. Use direct unlocked service primitives only when the outer
operation already owns the required resources, and document that ownership at
the call site.

App deletion closes coordinator admission before draining admitted work. Every
new app-scoped main-process mutation must therefore use the coordinator unless
it is already owned and drained by a domain-specific actor fence. Deletion-only
work uses the opaque deletion handle after `drain()`; ordinary handlers must
never bypass admission.

Keep `withLock` for non-app string identities such as canonical file paths and
token refreshes. Its string-only signature intentionally prevents the old
global `withLock(appId, ...)` pattern from returning.
