# Claude-driven GitHub Actions Workflows

Guidelines for the LLM-driven workflows in `.github/workflows/` that invoke `anthropics/claude-code-action` or `anthropics/claude-code-base-action` (e.g., `closed-issue-comment.yml`, `claude-triage.yml`, `claude-pr-review.yml`). Both actions wrap the same `claude` CLI under the hood, so settings/permission behavior is identical between them.

## Gate deterministic branching in the workflow, not the prompt

If a workflow's behavior depends on a deterministic check (identity comparisons, label presence, file paths, actor type, etc.), do the check in a workflow-level `if:` condition and split into separate jobs — do not leave it to the prompt.

**Why:** LLMs can conflate branches when the comment/PR body @mentions or describes the "other" party. A prior bug (see `closed-issue-comment.yml` history, dyad-sh/dyad#3228): the prompt told Claude "if COMMENT_AUTHOR == ISSUE_AUTHOR do X, else do Y," but when a maintainer closed an issue with a comment that mentioned `@original-author` and described the symptom, Claude fell into the author branch and re-opened the issue.

**How to apply:**

- Compare `github.event.comment.user.login` vs `github.event.issue.user.login` (and similar) in the job `if:` block, not the prompt.
- When one branch doesn't need judgment (e.g., posting a fixed reply), drop the LLM entirely and use `gh` directly.
- Add `github.event.*.user.type != 'Bot'` to prevent bot-comment loops when the same workflow can be triggered by its own output.

## Split LLM decisions from credentialed mutations

When a Claude workflow needs write credentials, prefer a two-job shape: the Claude job runs with read-only permissions and uploads a constrained JSON/Markdown artifact, then a separate `needs:` job downloads the artifact, checks out trusted helper scripts from `github.sha`, validates the artifact, creates the GitHub App token, and performs deterministic GitHub mutations.

When a headless Claude job must write local handoff artifacts, exclude project/local settings with `claude_args --setting-sources user`, explicitly pre-approve its inspection tools, and scope `Edit(...)` to the output directory via `--allowedTools`. Without the setting-source restriction, the repository's broad project allowlist merges with the scoped rule and defeats the intended boundary. After the action, verify every mandatory file with `test -s` before upload: `actions/upload-artifact`'s `if-no-files-found: error` still succeeds when only one of several listed paths exists, and Claude Code can report a successful session after denied tool calls.

When validating Markdown tables from an agent artifact, recognize separator rows by matching the complete row or every cell, not with a substring check such as `line.includes("---")`. Valid filenames and issue titles can contain three consecutive hyphens, and dropping one such row makes the summary and structured findings disagree.

## Harden the agent's permissions — `.claude/settings.json` merges into CI

Both `claude-code-action` and `claude-code-base-action` read `.claude/settings.json` from the workspace after `actions/checkout`, and the project's file is committed (tracked in git). **`permissions.allow` arrays merge across scopes — they do not replace each other.** From the Claude Code docs: _"Array settings merge across scopes. When the same array-valued setting (such as `permissions.allow`) appears in multiple scopes, the arrays are concatenated and deduplicated, not replaced."_ ([source](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)).

When upgrading the standalone `claude-code-base-action`, do not infer its bundled Claude Code version from the latest release tag: the repository can continue receiving immutable sync commits after tagged releases stop. Inspect `action.yml` at the exact commit, pin that SHA, and annotate the bundled CLI version so model compatibility is reviewable. Also verify its declared inputs: versions that do not declare `model` or `allowed_tools` ignore those top-level inputs with an `Unexpected input(s)` warning, so pass the equivalent `--model` and `--allowedTools` flags through `claude_args`.

This has two consequences that bite in CI:

1. **The `allowed_tools` action input is additive, not authoritative.** A workflow that sets `allowed_tools: "Read,Glob,Grep,Bash(git log:*)"` still inherits every entry in the project's `.claude/settings.json` — `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(gh pr create:*)`, `Bash(npm run:*)`, `Bash(rm -f ...)`, etc. The narrow list looks tight but isn't.
2. **For workflows that check out a fork (`pull_request_target` + PR head, or `workflow_run`), the `.claude/settings.json` is attacker-controlled** (modulo any author allowlist). A hostile PR can ship a maximally permissive settings file.

**Why:** the project file is broad on purpose — it exists for local dev, where the developer-in-the-loop and the on-disk permission hooks (`.claude/hooks/`) compensate. CI has neither.

**How to apply** (layered defenses, pick what fits the job):

1. **Skip `actions/checkout` entirely** when the agent doesn't need repo contents (classification, summarization, structured-output jobs). Without checkout, `.claude/settings.json` is never in the workspace.
2. **Disable project/local setting sources** when the job needs the repo but not its Claude configuration: pass `--setting-sources user` in `claude_args`. This is more reliable than deleting `.claude/settings*.json` before `claude-code-action`, because newer action versions restore sensitive configuration paths from the trusted base ref before launching Claude. For `claude-code-base-action`, which does not restore project configuration, stripping the files after checkout remains an option.
3. **Pass an inline `settings:` input** with an explicit `deny` list. This merges too, but `deny` beats `allow`, so it's an additional belt-and-suspenders layer. The action's `settings` input accepts a JSON string or a file path. Example for a tool-less classifier:
   ```yaml
   settings: |
     {
       "permissions": {
         "allow": [],
         "deny": ["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "Read", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "WebSearch"]
       }
     }
   ```
4. **For untrusted-input jobs, combine all three.** `closed-issue-comment.yml` is the reference example: no checkout, defensive `rm` tripwire (in case checkout gets re-added), and an inline deny-all `settings:`.

**Verify before merging a new claude-code-action workflow:** mentally compute the effective allowlist as `project .claude/settings.json` ∪ `allowed_tools input` ∪ `inline settings allow`, minus any `deny`. If that union is wider than the job actually needs — especially if the job handles untrusted input or checks out a fork — apply the mitigations above.

## Scope `Write`/`Edit`/`Read` rules to workspace-relative paths

`--allowedTools` path patterns without a leading `/` resolve relative to the checkout; a leading `/` is absolute. `claude-triage.yml` granted `Edit(/tmp/issue-triage/**)` while the decision file was `tmp/issue-triage/triage.json` inside the workspace, so every write was denied (`permission_denials_count: 13`, then `Claude did not write tmp/issue-triage/triage.json`, dyad-sh/dyad#4427) unless the model happened to use `Bash(echo:*)` redirection — 41 issues went unlabeled that way. Name the exact workspace-relative file and grant both `Write(...)` (new file) and `Edit(...)`: `Write(tmp/issue-triage/triage.json),Edit(tmp/issue-triage/triage.json)`.

## Issue triage (`claude-triage.yml`) layout

- The agent only writes `tmp/issue-triage/triage.json`; `scripts/issue-triage/triage-comment.mjs` validates it (enum fields, link-host allowlist, @-mention stripping, length caps, `fixedIn` must be a published release) and composes the single reporter-facing comment. To change what the bot tells reporters, add or edit an entry in `.github/prompts/triage-playbook.md` first; edit the prompt only for behavior rules.
- Trusted context (current version, `gh release list` minus drafts, GitHub/Supabase `status.json`, playbook) comes from `scripts/issue-triage/prepare-context.mjs` in a trusted step and reaches the prompt through `TEMPLATE_VARS_PATH` in `render-template.mjs`; the apply job rebuilds it rather than trusting the agent's artifact.
- Preview a decision without posting: `node scripts/issue-triage/preview.mjs scripts/issue-triage/examples/node-not-found.json`. A missing or invalid decision still posts a fallback comment and adds `triage/failed`; `apply-triage` runs with `if: always()` for that reason.
