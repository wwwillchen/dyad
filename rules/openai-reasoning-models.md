# OpenAI Reasoning Model Errors

When using OpenAI reasoning models (o1, o3, o4-mini) via LiteLLM/Azure, you may see:

```
Item 'rs_...' of type 'reasoning' was provided without its required following item.
```

OpenAI's Responses API requires reasoning items to always be followed by an output item (text, tool-call). This error occurs when:

- The model produces reasoning then immediately makes tool calls (no text between)
- The stream is interrupted after reasoning but before output
- Only reasoning was generated in a turn

The fix in `src/ipc/utils/ai_messages_utils.ts` filters orphaned reasoning parts within `cleanMessage()` before sending conversation history back to OpenAI.

## Dyad Engine model aliases

When a Dyad Engine alias is backed by an OpenAI reasoning model, create it with `provider.responses(...)` and pass `providerId: "openai"`. Passing the alias provider (for example, `"auto"`) prevents `getExtraProviderOptionsForEngine()` from adding reasoning effort, summaries, encrypted reasoning content, and `store: false`.

Every multi-step `streamText` loop must clean or sanitize the complete message array in `prepareStep`, including same-turn tool-call/results. With `store: false`, replaying an OpenAI/Azure reasoning `itemId` (`rs_...`) on the post-tool request fails with “Item with id ... not found”; use the shared `cleanMessage` / `sanitizeStepMessages` helpers rather than cleaning only persisted history.

Keep provider-specific transcript repairs at the destination-provider boundary. LiteLLM can encode Gemini thought signatures in long tool-call IDs (`call_...__thought__...`), and Gemini continuations require that exact ID. If OpenAI Responses needs a shorter `call_id`, normalize matching call/result IDs based on the resolved runtime model, not the persisted display selection (Auto Sidekick resolves to `auto/auto`, while non-Pro Auto may resolve directly to Google). This includes `auto/value` and, pragmatically, runtime `auto/auto` because its common path starts with OpenAI; a rare same-turn fallback from Auto to Gemini may lose the encoded signature. Do not perform this rewrite in provider-agnostic parsing/cleaning or for a runtime model resolved directly to Gemini.
