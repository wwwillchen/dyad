Milestone 2: turn Curbside into a three-sided marketplace. Everything from milestone 1 — its routes, test ids and behaviour, including `GET /api/me` and the `/` redirects — must keep working.

**Actor types.** Every signed-in user is a **customer**. Two more are additive, each gained by an explicit action: creating a restaurant makes that user its **merchant**, and `POST /api/courier/register` makes a user a **courier**, recording the name they signed up with. Extend `GET /api/me` to also return `isMerchant`, `isCourier` and `restaurantIds` (restaurants the caller owns) — never anything about anybody else.

**What each actor may see.** A customer sees only their own orders. A merchant sees at `/merchant/orders` and `GET /api/merchant/orders` only orders belonging to restaurants they own — never another merchant's. A courier sees at `/courier` a pool of **available deliveries** — orders that are `ready` and unclaimed — exposed at `GET /api/courier/deliveries/available`, and at `/courier/deliveries` the deliveries that courier claimed, exposed at `GET /api/courier/deliveries`. A courier may read an order's detail **only once they have claimed it**. Requests from a user lacking the required actor type return HTTP 403 and no data, and those pages draw neither list nor empty state. The one page open to everybody is `/courier` itself — that is where a user who is not yet a courier finds `courier-register-button` — but it lists available deliveries only to couriers.

**Order lifecycle.** The statuses are `placed`, `accepted`, `preparing`, `ready`, `picked_up`, `delivered` and `cancelled`. Transitions happen through one endpoint, `POST /api/orders/[id]/transition` with body `{ "to": "<status>" }`, and each legal edge belongs to exactly one actor:

| From        | To          | Who may do it                         |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `placed`    | `accepted`  | the merchant who owns the restaurant  |
| `accepted`  | `preparing` | the merchant who owns the restaurant  |
| `preparing` | `ready`     | the merchant who owns the restaurant  |
| `ready`     | `picked_up` | the courier who claimed that delivery |
| `picked_up` | `delivered` | the courier who claimed that delivery |
| `placed`    | `cancelled` | the customer who placed the order     |

Any other transition is illegal: refuse with HTTP 409 and no change. A legal edge requested by the wrong actor: refuse with HTTP 403 and no change. Enforce both on the server; hiding buttons is not enough.

**Claiming.** `POST /api/deliveries/[id]/claim` (the id is the order's id) assigns the calling courier to an order that is `ready` and unclaimed, and returns the delivery. It must be **atomic**: of several simultaneous claims exactly one may succeed, never a read followed by an unguarded write. A claim on an already-claimed delivery returns HTTP 409 and leaves the existing courier in place.

**Delivery and order shapes.** A delivery object — returned by the claim endpoint and by both courier list endpoints — carries the order's `id`, its `status` and `courierId`: the claiming courier's user id, or `null` while unclaimed. `GET /api/orders/[id]` and `GET /api/merchant/orders` also carry the order's `id`, `status` and `courierId` per order.

**Routes.** `/merchant/orders`, `/courier`, `/courier/deliveries`.

**`data-testid` attributes (exact).**
