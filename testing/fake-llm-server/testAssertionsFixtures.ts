/**
 * Fake responses for the recorder's "Generate test proposal" flow.
 *
 * Three different things are faked here, because three different prompts are
 * involved:
 *
 * 1. The AGENT turn. The recorder's "Generate test proposal" button sends a chat
 *    prompt containing the recorded statements — the test is NOT a file yet, so
 *    there is nothing to read_file. We answer with a single
 *    `generate_test_assertions` tool call, deriving the name, steps and
 *    assertions from the statements in the prompt.
 *
 * 2. The approve-time CODE SYNTHESIS pass
 *    (src/prompts/test_assertions_prompt.ts buildAssertionCodePayload), a plain
 *    one-off model call that still expects JSON back. Shared by the
 *    chat-completions and responses fake routes so it works regardless of which
 *    protocol the selected fake model uses.
 *
 * 3. The rest of the turn after the user answers the card. `generate_test_assertions`
 *    blocks until then, so the approval comes back as its TOOL RESULT and the
 *    same turn continues — there is no new user message to key off. A card whose
 *    turn is gone (reload, stopped stream) falls back to sending a real user
 *    message instead, so both are matched. Answered with plain text so E2E
 *    exercises the hand-off without spawning a real Playwright run.
 *
 * The matchers key off exact line-anchored labels, not bare substrings — an
 * ordinary chat prompt that happens to mention "Statements:" must not be
 * hijacked into a JSON assertion plan.
