/**
 * The setup flow over a real SSH connection, without the app around it.
 *
 * Dyad's own SSH client talks to a real ssh2 server here, so preflight, the
 * installer and the tinker transcripts these tests reach are parsed from the
 * shapes the library actually produces rather than ones a hand-written fake
 * finds convenient.
 *
 * Only the two HTTP steps are stubbed: whether a dashboard answers and
 * whether a certificate is issued are not questions a server on loopback can
 * be asked, and neither goes over SSH.
 *
 * These live here rather than in e2e because none of them looks at the
 * screen. The packaged app proves the wiring — that the handler is registered
 * and the panel renders what it returns — and that is what the two remaining
 * Playwright specs are for.
