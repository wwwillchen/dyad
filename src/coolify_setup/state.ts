 * it, since leaving that screen is invited and a background refetch can
 * replace it. A copy in the renderer goes stale the moment either happens.
 *
 * Every event from a running setup echoes its invocation ref, so an answer
 * from a run that was cancelled or superseded cannot revive or overwrite
 * whatever the user is looking at now. Correlation is by operation rather than
 * by address: the same server can be set up twice, and the second run must not
 * inherit the first one's answers.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches into `src/ipc`: a pure machine module owns its own
 * types, and the wire schema asserts against them rather than the other way
 * round.
