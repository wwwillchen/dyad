 * A stock Coolify serves plain HTTP, so Dyad's API token — which carries root
 * abilities and can read database connection strings — would cross the network
 * in the clear on every deploy, not just once at setup.
 *
 * Coolify already knows how to fix this: give it a domain and its proxy asks
 * Let's Encrypt for a certificate. The missing piece is the domain, and a
 * server's own address is one: `1.2.3.4.sslip.io` resolves to 1.2.3.4 with
 * nothing to configure.
 *
 * Attempted rather than required. Certificates depend on a third party that can
 * refuse, so this checks whether it worked and puts the instance back on plain
 * HTTP if it did not. Verified against Coolify 4.3.2: a domain that cannot be
 * validated leaves port 8000 serving normally, so the fallback is a real one.
