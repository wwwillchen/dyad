            Dyad clears this preview's cookies and local storage before
            recording. This usually signs you out and removes anything the app
            stored in the browser. With app-specific localhost addresses, other
            apps' storage is left alone; shared localhost cookies are kept and
            may leave you signed in. With ordinary localhost addresses, cookies
            are shared, so this may also sign you out of other apps. Your app's
            code and database aren't touched.
