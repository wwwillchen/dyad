/**
 * Pinned above the composer while a stopped turn settles.
 *
 * Stopping is not instant. The agent awaits its in-flight tool, and a
 * `run_tests` call first kills the Playwright process tree and then runs a
 * teardown that accepts no AbortSignal — deleting the temporary Neon branch,
 * whose delete retries with backoff, and removing the run's sandbox copy of the
 * app. That wait can pass a minute, and the composer stays locked for all of
 * it. A sandboxed run never touches the user's own `.env.local` or preview; a
 * fallback run (sandboxing off or unavailable) uses the normal preview.
 *
 * The transcript's inline status card scrolls out of view; this stays fused to
 * the composer the user just clicked Stop in, so the wait is never unexplained.
