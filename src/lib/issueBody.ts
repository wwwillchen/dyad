/**
 * The report is handed to GitHub as a prefilled URL, so the whole body has to
 * survive percent-encoding inside a query string. Measured against
 * github.com/dyad-sh/dyad/issues/new: requests are served up to ~6,860
 * characters, answer 500 from there to ~8,000, and 414 beyond that. The
 * ceiling below leaves ~5% of headroom under the observed cliff.
 *
 * The large budgets -- prose, logs, updater logs, the title -- are sized so
 * that all of them at maximum still fit, and that case is pinned by tests.
 * The per-field caps are a backstop rather than part of that sum: every
 * diagnostic field is capped so that no single one can push the body over,
 * which is what the per-field tests pin. Nine saturating at once would go
 * over, and no machine reports values like that -- in practice only a
 * non-ASCII Windows node path comes close to its cap.
 *
 * `buildIssueUrl` never truncates -- the inputs are capped instead, which is
 * what makes the limit visible to the reporter while they type rather than
 * silently after they submit.
 *
 * The budgets below are counted in ENCODED characters, not in characters
 * typed, because that is the unit the ceiling is measured in and the two are
 * far apart: a CJK character costs 9, an emoji 12, and ordinary punctuation
 * (newline, quote, brace, colon) 3 each. Counting raw string length would let
 * a reporter writing Chinese -- or pasting a stack trace -- build a URL three
 * to nine times over the ceiling while the counter still showed room left.
