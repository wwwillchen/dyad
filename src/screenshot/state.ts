/**
 * Per-app preview screenshot pipeline.
 *
 * Dependency graph: producer facade -> screenshot -> shared preview adapter.
 * The screenshot machine never imports another machine's controller. The
 * requestCapture facade admits CAPTURE_REQUESTED directly to the per-app
 * controller.
 *
 * Execution and staleness policy: event transactions are handled FIFO and
 * accepted lifecycle/completion events are never silently dropped. Reserved
 * commands start immediately and independently, so async effects may overlap,
 * preserving the controller's original direct-execution model. While work has
 * not reached commit resolution, a newer request supersedes the current source;
 * once an async capture is in flight, only the latest newer source is queued.
 * Replaced settle callbacks are stale by settleToken, and async capture
 * callbacks with any other requestId are stale and ignored.
