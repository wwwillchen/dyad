/**
 * An app's Coolify record, as a shape that cannot hold a contradiction.
 *
 * This began as seven nullable columns on `apps` written from twenty-eight
 * places, each deciding which subset to clear, and nearly every bug here was
 * the same one: cleared the application id but not the URL, cleared the URL
 * but not the deploy time, kept an application belonging to a server the app
 * had already left. It is a row in `coolify_app_connections` now, so a
 * connection either exists or does not, and the server, project and
 * environment are NOT NULL — the database will not hold half of one either.
 *
 * A change is applied by `applyCoolifyConnectionChange` and turned into a row
 * by `coolifyConnectionRow`, which returns null for a connection that should
 * not exist. There is no way to write a subset of a row, so there is no way
 * to write an inconsistent one.
 *
 * Pure by design: no database, no clock, no Electron. The caller supplies the
 * current record and the time.
