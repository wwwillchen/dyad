 * Renderer binding for the Coolify setup machine.
 *
 * The snapshot is owned by the main process. Subscribing happens before the
 * initial read so a run that finishes mid-mount is not missed, and a
 * late-arriving read never overwrites a state already pushed.
 *
 * One hook rather than a query in each panel that wants it. Two components
 * read this at once, and React Query runs whichever observer's queryFn it
 * picked for the key — so a plain one anywhere is a plain one everywhere,
 * and the guard below would be bypassed by the copy that did not have it.
 */
/**
 * How many pushed states have landed, so a read can tell whether it was
 * overtaken. Counted rather than flagged: the read compares against what it
 * started with, and a refetch after an earlier event must not read as
 * overtaken by that old one.
 *
 * Shared rather than held per caller. React Query keeps one set of options
 * per key, taken from whichever observer last fetched — and that caller can
 * unmount while another still reads the query, leaving a count that has
 * stopped advancing to decide whether a read was overtaken. Only its changing
 * matters, so several callers counting the same event is not a problem.
