/**
 * Types for the per-app run-state machine.
 *
 * This file is types-only: no runtime imports, no runtime code. The pure
 * transition function lives in `transition.ts`; side effects live in
 * `commands.ts`; orchestration (invocation minting, serial command execution)
 * lives in `controller.ts`.
 *
 * Every non-idle state carries both `appId` and `invocationRef`. The app ID is
 * domain data; the ref is the globally unique correlation identity for one
 * run / restart / rebuild / stop operation. Async completions and producer
 * events echo the ref so callbacks from superseded process lifetimes cannot
 * advance the current operation.
