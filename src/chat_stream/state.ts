/**
 * Per-chat stream lifecycle state.
 *
 * Happy path: idle -> starting -> streaming -> finalizing -> idle.
 *
 * - `starting`: the renderer has invoked `chat:stream` but the main process
 *   has not yet confirmed registration of its AbortController (confirmed via
 *   the `chat:stream:start` event, or implicitly by the first chunk).
 * - `cancelling`: the user requested a cancel while a stream was in flight.
 *   `registered` records whether main had confirmed registration when we last
 *   checked. Main tracks the AbortController synchronously when `chat:stream`
 *   arrives (before `chat:stream:start` is sent), so an abort issued while
 *   still unregistered normally aborts the real stream — whose sole terminal
 *   `wasCancelled` end then arrives with `registered` still false and MUST
 *   finalize (main never sends `chat:stream:start` for a stream aborted
 *   before admission). If the abort instead raced ahead of `chat:stream`
 *   entirely, main found nothing, sent nothing, and the stream proceeds to
 *   registration — the `registered` event re-issues the abort.
 * - `finalizing`: the terminal end event arrived; end side effects (DB
 *   re-sync, invalidations, file refresh) are running.
 * - `errored`: the stream terminated with an error. A new submit is allowed.
 *
 * `invocationRef` is the complete, globally unique correlation identity.
 * Events carrying another operation's ref never advance the machine.
