const NO_DRAFT_MESSAGE = `There is no finished recording waiting to become a test, so nothing was shown to the user and no file was touched.

This tool only works right after the user stops a recording and clicks "Generate test proposal" in the recorder bar — it reads the recording Dyad parked at that moment. Tell the user to record the flow in the preview and click "Generate test proposal"; to add assertions to a spec that already exists on disk, edit it with search_replace instead.`;

const STALE_DRAFT_MESSAGE = (
  currentId: string,
) => `The recording id you sent doesn't match the recording waiting for assertions, so nothing was shown to the user and no file was touched. The user recorded something else while this request was queued.

Do NOT resend the same steps against the new id — they describe a flow that is no longer the one waiting. Ask the user whether they want assertions for the recording they just finished (id \`${currentId}\`); if they do, they should ask again so you get its statements.`;

const DESCRIPTION = `Turn a just-finished recording into a reviewable test proposal: name the test, describe each recorded step in plain English, and propose the assertions that should check it. The user reviews the proposal in a chat card — editing, deleting, reordering — and Dyad generates the test file from it when they approve. You never write the spec.

This tool BLOCKS until the user answers the card, then tells you what happened. The turn is not over when you call it.

<when_to_use>
Use this when the user asks for assertions for a flow they just recorded with Dyad's recorder. The recorded statements are given to you in the request — the test does NOT exist as a file yet, and there is nothing to read_file. Do NOT use it to write a new test from scratch (write the spec with write_file instead), and do NOT use it on a spec that already exists on disk (edit that with search_replace).
</when_to_use>

<how_to_use>
1. Read the numbered statements in the user's message. Those indices are the ones this tool expects — don't renumber them.
2. Send a \`testName\` for the flow, one \`steps\` entry per statement translating it into one plain-English sentence, plus the assertions you want to propose. Copy the recording id from the request into \`recordingId\` exactly — it is what ties your plan to the recording it describes.
3. Wait. The call does not come back until the user approves the card or closes it, and the tool result tells you which. Do NOT call it a second time, and do NOT try to write or run anything while it is open — the spec does not exist yet.
4. Do what the tool result says: run the spec it names, or stop if the user closed the card.
</how_to_use>

<assertions>
BE CONSERVATIVE. Most recorded tests need one to three assertions. Many need zero.
- Assert only an OUTCOME the preceding statements should have produced.
- Never invent text, URLs, counts, roles, or test ids that don't already appear in the statements. If you can't ground it, don't propose it.
- Never assert that an element you just interacted with exists.
- Don't assert after \`signIn(page)\` or \`page.goto(...)\` unless navigation is the point of the flow.
- At most one assertion per statement.
- Prefer web-first assertions: expect(locator).toBeVisible() / .toHaveText() / .toHaveValue() / .toBeChecked(), and expect(page).toHaveURL().
- Reuse the exact locator chain from a nearby statement wherever possible.
</assertions>

<correct_example>
For a recording whose statements are:
  0: await page.goto("/");
  1: await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Increment" }).click();

{
  "testName": "Increment the counter",
  "steps": [
    { "index": 0, "text": "Open the home page" },
