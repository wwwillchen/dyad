- Pass \`testFile\` (e.g. "e2e-tests/checkout.spec.ts") to run one spec — it's required, so always target the single spec you're working on. Use the exact path of a spec that exists under e2e-tests/ (the one you just wrote/edited) — don't guess. If the path doesn't match a real spec, the tool won't run anything and will reply with the list of specs that DO exist, so you can retry with a correct path.
- Unless you just wrote or edited the spec this turn, READ it with read_file before running it — you need its current content to know the test() titles (for grep) and to interpret failures against what the test actually does.
- By default the whole file runs, so a pass means every test in the spec passes.
- Run the whole file by default. Only add \`grep\` (a regex passed to Playwright's --grep, matched against full hierarchical test titles) when you have a specific reason to narrow the run — e.g. one test keeps failing while the spec's other tests already passed and rerunning them all is slow. A narrowed pass only verifies the tests it matched, not the rest of the file. If the pattern matches no runnable test, the tool reports that nothing executed.
- Requires the app's dev server to be running (the user starts it with the Run button in the preview panel).
- On failure you get the error text plus the paths of Playwright's artifacts (error-context.md page snapshot, screenshot) — read error-context.md with read_file to see the page state, then fix and rerun.
- You get ${MAX_ATTEMPTS} fix attempts per spec per turn. When the limit is reached, stop and summarize the situation for the user.
- If you suspect a failure is flaky, rerun once with \`flakeCheck: true\` (does not count against the limit).
- Never rerun something that already passed: once a target (or the whole file) is green and you haven't changed any files, the tool refuses the run — move on instead.`,
