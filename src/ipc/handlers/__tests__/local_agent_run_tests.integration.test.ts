// Exercises the local-agent run_tests tool end-to-end over the HYBRID harness
// (real <ChatPanel> over the real IPC stack). The fixture writes a spec, then
// calls run_tests. No dev server is running in the harness, so the real tool
// short-circuits on its dev-server pre-check and returns the actionable "app
// isn't running" warning (uncounted) — a deterministic path that avoids running
// Playwright-inside-Playwright. Asserts the tool XML + narration land in the
// persisted assistant message.
//
// Sandboxing is turned OFF for that reason: a sandboxed run does not need the
// preview, so the pre-check no longer short-circuits and the tool would go on
// to copy the app and install Playwright for real — minutes of work inside a
// unit-test run, and a different failure on every machine (`spawn pnpm ENOENT`
// on a runner without pnpm, a download failure on one without network). The
// guard's two branches are covered as units in `run_tests.spec.ts`; what this
// file is for is the wiring around them.
