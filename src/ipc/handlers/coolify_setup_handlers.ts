 *
 * The error object is kept rather than replaced with one of ours. The failure
 * it carries never reaches the renderer — the serialized error has no such
 * field — but it is read on the way out: shouldFilterTelemetryException drops
 * an "unreachable" outright, as a server that does not answer is the user's
 * own network rather than a fault here. A plain Error would carry no failure,
 * match nothing else that filter looks for, and start reporting the connects
 * this speaks for — the ones from an address with a slash in it — as
 * exceptions. Every other failed connect keeps the error it was given.
