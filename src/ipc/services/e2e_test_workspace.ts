 * instantaneous, so a Run pressed right after launch would otherwise be
 * deleted during setup and surface as an unexplained ENOENT.
 *
 * Artifacts are otherwise only replaced by the next run of the same app, so
 * without `refreshKnownAppIds` a deleted app's screenshots and traces would sit
 * in user data forever with no surface that shows they exist. It is a callback,
