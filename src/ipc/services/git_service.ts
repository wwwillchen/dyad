 * service instead of sequencing individual git functions themselves.
 *
 * Prefer methods here for stage/commit flows so call sites depend on one
 * mockable seam. Multi-step sequences (stage-all-and-commit, init-and-commit)
 * clearly belong here; the single-file `stageFile`/`commitFile` helpers live
 * here too so the "save = stage, commit later" flow shares that same seam and
 * documents the .gitignore no-op behavior in one place. Genuinely unrelated
 * one-off git operations should keep using `git_utils.ts` directly.

   * - `"untracked"`: git removed nothing, and the file is still on disk for the
   *   caller to delete. There is no history to restore from.
