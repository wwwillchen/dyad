 *
 * This is safe precisely because the branch is a copy-on-write throwaway that is
 * deleted at teardown: the account only ever exists on the isolated branch, so a
 * later run (a fresh branch) never sees it, and it is created through Better
 * Auth's own signup endpoint — never by inserting into auth tables, which
 * commonly produces a user that exists but cannot log in.
 *
 * Throws `DyadError` when signup is rejected, and when it succeeds but produces
 * an account that can't sign in (email verification required); callers treat
 * either as "auth unavailable" and record/run unauthenticated rather than
 * failing the whole flow.
