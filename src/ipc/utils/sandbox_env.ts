 * Two channels have to be closed together, because an app reads whichever one
 * answers first:
 *
 * - the workspace's `.env.local`, which provider isolation rewrites; and
 * - the environment Dyad itself was launched with, which every child inherits.
 *
 * The second is the one that bites: `dotenv` does not overwrite a variable that
 * is already set, so a `DATABASE_URL` exported in the shell that started Dyad
 * silently wins over the isolated value written into the sandbox. Stripping the
 * inherited copy is what makes the sandbox's own file authoritative — it is not
 * only a Supabase concern, and a Neon branch run needs it just as much.
